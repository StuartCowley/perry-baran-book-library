# Book-Library

An Express.js API that interacts with a sequelize database via CRUD requests to store and interact with reader and book information.

Sequelize uses MySQL for tests and Postgres for production.

Implements Test-Driven development using Mocha and Chai.

Created as part of the Manchester Codes full-stack web development boot-camp.

App hosted on [Render](https://book-library-f9gi.onrender.com).

```
$ docker run -d -p 3307:3306 --name book_library_mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql

Create a `.env` file in the root of the repo with the following values:

```
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=book_library
DB_USER=root
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3307
```

Create a `.env.test` file in the root of the repo with the following values:

```bash
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=book_library_dev
DB_USER=root
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3307
```

## Commands

To run the server use:

```
$ npm start
```

To run all tests use:

```
$ npm test
```

To just run unit tests use:

```
$ npm run unit-test
```
